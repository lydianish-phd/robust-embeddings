# Robust Sentence Embeddings for User-Generated Content (UGC)

This repository contains the code and experiments for my PhD work on **robust sentence embeddings for user-generated content (UGC)**, focusing on aligning standard and non-standard language in a shared semantic space.  
It covers **Experiment V (RoLASER)** and provides the foundations for **Experiment VI (RoSONAR)** from my dissertation.

An earlier version of this work was published at **LREC–COLING 2024**.

## 🔍 Motivation

Most sentence encoders are trained on clean, standard text and degrade sharply when applied to UGC such as social media content, which exhibits:
- spelling and grammatical errors,
- slang, acronyms, and abbreviations,
- expressive typography (emojis, repetitions, leetspeak),
- tokenisation-breaking character-level perturbations.

This work tackles robustness **at the sentence level**, framing UGC robustness as a **bitext alignment problem in embedding space**:
> *How close are the embeddings of a standard sentence and its non-standard counterpart?*

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

We propose training **UGC-robust sentence encoders** using:
- **Knowledge distillation** (teacher–student training),
- **Synthetic UGC generation** from standard text,
- **Embedding alignment losses** that minimise the distance between standard and non-standard variants.

Rather than normalising text explicitly, the model learns to **abstract away surface-level variation**.

## 🧪 Experiment V — RoLASER

### RoLASER: Robust LASER-style Sentence Embeddings

**RoLASER** is a Transformer-based student encoder trained to map non-standard English sentences close to their standard equivalents in the **LASER embedding space**.

🔗 **RoLASER GitHub repository:**  
https://github.com/lydianish-phd/RoLASER

**Key features:**
- Teacher: frozen **LASER** encoder
- Students:
  - **RoLASER** (token-level, RoBERTa-style)
  - **cRoLASER** (character-aware variant)
- Training objective: **MSE loss between teacher and student embeddings**
- Data: standard English paired with **synthetically generated UGC**

**Main findings:**
- Substantially improves robustness to both **synthetic and natural UGC**
- Handles tokenisation-breaking perturbations better than LASER
- Maintains (or slightly improves) performance on standard text
- Token-level models outperform character-aware models in this setting

## 🔬 Evaluation

Robustness is evaluated as a **sentence alignment task**, using:
- Average cosine distance
- **xSIM** and **xSIM++** (bitext mining proxy metrics)

Datasets include:
- **MultiLexNorm** (natural UGC)
- **ROCS-MT** (UGC + standardised variants)
- **FLORES** with controlled synthetic UGC perturbations

Downstream evaluations include:
- Sentence (pair) classification
- Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)

---

## 🧩 Synthetic UGC Generation

UGC is generated from standard text using probabilistic combinations of:
- abbreviations & slang,
- misspellings & typos,
- leetspeak,
- whitespace and segmentation noise,
- contractions and expansions.

This enables controlled robustness analysis while highlighting the **gap between synthetic and natural UGC**.

## 🔁 Experiment VI — RoSONAR (context)

This repository also provides the conceptual and experimental groundwork for **RoSONAR**, which extends the approach to **machine translation** by:
- training a robust sentence encoder aligned to **SONAR**,
- pairing it with a frozen multilingual SONAR decoder,
- evaluating robustness transfer across languages.

> Note: full RoSONAR training code may live in a separate repository.

## 🛠️ Implementation

- Frameworks: **Fairseq**, **PyTorch**
- Architectures: Transformer encoders (token-level & character-aware)
- Training:
  - multi-GPU distributed training
  - synthetic data augmentation
  - large-scale embedding distillation

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- Synthetic UGC does not fully capture real-world UGC distributions
- Robust embeddings do not automatically guarantee robust MT
- Domain adaptation remains a key challenge

This repository should be viewed as a **research artefact** supporting the dissertation rather than a polished end-user library.
